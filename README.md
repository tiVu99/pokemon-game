# Pokemon Game

## Project Goal 

In this project, you will be using Python Classes to create a game system similar to the popular game series Pokémon. 
If you’re unfamiliar with Pokémon, it is a game where creatures (Pokémon) battle against each other. 
Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. 
In this project we’ll make several classes that interact with each other so you can create your own Pokémon battles!
